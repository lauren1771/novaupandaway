Welcome to *Up and Away*
++++++++++++++++++++++++

This Nova Award explores the world of fluid dynamics, and how it affects your everyday life. Fluid dynamics is the study of how fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) behave and interact with other materials.

.. note:: **What is fluid dynamics?**

   The very informative site `kids.kiddle.co <https://kids.kiddle.co/Fluid_dynamics>`__ offers a great introduction to what *fluid dynamics is*. The authors of that website provide the following definition:

   Fluid Dynamics talks about how fluids (liquids and gases) work. It is one of the oldest parts of the study of Physics, and is studied by physicists, mathematicians, and engineers. Mathematics can describe how fluids move using mathematical formulas called equations. The fluid dynamics of gases are called *aerodynamics*.

      Calculated flow around an airfoil. The fluid moves according to specific equations of physics, such as Bernoulli's theorem, Navier-Stokes equations, and Poiseuille's equation (this image was downloaded from `kids.kiddle.co <https://kids.kiddle.co/Fluid_dynamics>`__). 

   
   Understanding how fluids behave helps us understand things like flight or ocean currents. For example, fluid dynamics can be used to understand weather, because clouds and air are both fluids. Fluid dynamics can also be used to understand how aeroplanes fly through the air or how ships and submarines move through water.
      
   
   
.. warning:: When completing this Award both the youth and involved adult leaders must obey all rules of `Safe Scouting <https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/gss/>`_. This includes (1) Completing Cyber Chip training prior to starting this activity and (2) **ALWAYS** involve at least 2 adults in all your communications with a leader, including online. If you send an email to your counselor, always add the address of another adult leader or a parent/guardian. Never reply to a message sent by an adult leader unless another adult has been copied on the email. Report any issue to your parents/guardians!	

Instructions
------------

1. Identify a **Nova Counselor** either within your unit, district, or council.
2. This site provides you a platform for learning and you can easily follow all requirements using the navigation menu on the left. 
3. Once you have identified a Counselor, you can start working on requirements. 
4. The most important aspect in any scientific endeavor is to **properly document progress**. This will be done, here, using a google sheet as described in more details below.

Documenting your progress
-------------------------

0. You can use the template below to report completion. To work on this Nova Award, you can also use a detailed worksheet provided by the BSA. Click `here <http://usscouts.org/advance/nova/workbooks/Scout-Nova-9.pdf>`__ to have access. The file below is used to record approval. 
1. A template worksheet can be found `here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrJZvJ-cOgQF0DnsnITEBgxBr4oKlDOy3d2Lqm-zge4/edit?usp=sharing>`_. This is a *Google document*. **You will not be able to modify it until you make your own copy as I will now describe for you.**
2. Once you have opened the file on google doc, go to :code:`File` :math:`\rightarrow` :code:`Make a Copy`.
3. Save the file with the following name: *Nova_designed_to_crunch_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME*
4. You will use that file to enter your progress and share with your counselor.
5. You can share your own copy of the worksheet with your counselor using the following procedure.
	a) Click on the SHARE button on the top-right. 
	b) Click on "get link".
	c) Send the link to your counselor.

   For your convenience, these instructions are also available as a short Youtube video below. 

.. Note:: This document provides you a guide to complete the Nova award! All requirements are marked with the following symbol: :math:`\boxed{\mathbb{REQ}\Large \rightsquigarrow}`. In addition, a number of fun *Additional Challenges* are provided in boxes for your entertainment. 

If you have any question
------------------------

Contact your counselor or your scoutmaster! If you have questions about the program, contact Vincent Meunier  by `email <mailto:vinmeunier@gmail.com>`_ (as usual, make sure you copy an additional adult to all your communications with a leader!).
